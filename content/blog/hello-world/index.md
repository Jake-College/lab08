### Classes
I have 3 classes to do work in, those being Document Engineering, Introduction to Communication Competencies, Adult Psychopathology, as well as weekly meetings with my advisors. I do work in all classes I attend (if somewhat slowly) and finish my assignments mostly on time. This first semester of college is decently easy, which is something I should be happy about.

### Projects
I have currently done two large writing assignments in Communication Competencies, eight labs in Document Engineering, and have a major writing assignment for Psychopathology that I am working on.
