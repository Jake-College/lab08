### What even is this?
Deception City is a social deduction game (SDG) that I work on in my spare time, hosted over a Discord server that I own. The server has just recently reached 100 players, and I take great pride in how far it has come in its five years of existence. The server is, as of right now, on hiatus so that I may make changes to the server's balance.

I run the server solely for the enjoyment of myself and others in the server to give us all something to do in our free time. I'm always hoping to get more people involved.
