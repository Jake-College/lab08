Models - Various AI models are at your disposal, and each has its own process and use. Determine which is most fit for the task you are performing for optimal usage.

Temperature - This determines the variability and creativity of the AI responses. A higher temperature means more, so it would be more useful for creative writing, while lower temperatures are better suited for analtyics.

Maximum Length - This determines how long the AI responses can be.

Top P - This adds more randomness to the AI responses by increasing the variability of words that can be generated.
